# FlaskProjects
------------------------------
About this repo: This repo has all that I have done (that I can publically share) in Flask (using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, SQLite, Django, JinJa) 
through projects that I did for some online courses / for myself in my free time.

------------------------------
This repo is made specially to show my gradual progress in learning Flask and
the projects that I make on the way. 

This is ideally targetted towards people who are interested to check my skills in this field,
and if you're one of those people, then my latest Flask Project is the last file that I have uploaded here.

------------------------------
Also, I make some videos on Youtube under the channel name: 'Developer Mawa'. 

So, if you're interested in the hackathon projects that I make, 
alongside some sort of casual Arduino / Python / Data Science related projects that I play around with,
then you should check out my content there:
